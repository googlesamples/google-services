iOS Banner Example
==================
This is a minimal example showing how to place a banner ad into an iOS
application.

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google Mobile Ads SDK, but is
compatible with Cocoapods and includes a Podfile. We recommend using Cocoapods
to reference the SDK. You can do this by running:

`pod install`

If you don't have Cocoapods installed, visit
http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3 to get started.

After running pod update, Cocoapods creates a .xcworkspace that you can open
and run.

Replace Your Ad Unit ID
-----------------------
This example comes with a preconfigured ad unit ID. You should create an ad
unit ID on http://apps.admob.com and use that ad unit ID in your own apps.
